    <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
    
    <p>Hello, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/kniffen">Kniffen</a> and this is my space on the internet.</p>
    <p>I started this website for various reasons, mainly to document projects I'm working on.</p>
    <p>But also to get more practice writing documentation and also writing in general.</p>

    <h4>Projects you say?</h4>
    <p>I'm mostly working on software development, and JavaScript is my language of choice.</p>
    <p>But I'm also interested in working with and learning other languages, such as C/C++ and Java.</p>
    <p>There's also the occasional Art project, I enjoy working with vector graphics and have a <a href="/art">portfolio</a> of current work.</p>
