  <article class="post-content">
    <p>FullStream is an alternative and simplified interface for browsing and viewing <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a> content.<br />
It originated from wanting a solution to watch and browse Twitch at the same time in a full screen environment, hence the name.<br />
Since then it has evolved to be more and more feature rich, though development was put on hold from late 2016 until early 2019.  </p>
<p><a name="browsing"></a></p>
<h4>Browsing</h4>
<p>When you first visit <a href="https://fullstream.kniffen.space">FullStream</a> you'll be presented with the current featured and top streams on <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>.<br />
By using the menu bar on the left you can navigate to other content such as the top <a href="#categories">Categories</a>, top <a href="#videos">Videos</a>, <a href="#search">Search</a> or <a href="">Settings</a>.<br />
If you click on the thumbnail, FullStream will automatically minimize the browsing section and load up the stream and chat depending on your <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.<br />
Clicking on the channel's name will take you to that <a href="#channels">Channel's</a> page and clicking on the <a href="#categories">Category</a> name will show you other channels streaming under that particular category.<br />
There's also some additional information shown under the thumbnail. Such as the stream title, viewer count and amount of time the stream has been live.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-streams.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot streams" /></p>
<p><a name="streams"></a></p>
<h4>Streams</h4>
<p>When watching a stream you'll always have a bar at the top of the screen, this bar shows various information about the stream depending on your <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.<br />
On the right side of the bar there's a menu with three icons, by clicking these you call various actions.<br />
The speech bubble hides or shows the chat, the burger minimizes the stream and brings back the <a href="#browsing">Browsing</a> section and the X closes the stream completely.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-stream.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot stream" /></p>
<p><a name="channels"></a></p>
<h4>Channels</h4>
<p>If you click a channel's name anywhere it's displayed you'll be presented with its page.<br />
On this page you'll be able to view various information and content associated with the channel, such as panels, videos, clips, events, followers and more.<br />
You'll also be able to follow and unfollow the channel, and view it on Twitch in case there's some content that FullStream does not provide such as extentions.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-channel.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot channel" /></p>
<p><a name="Following"></a></p>
<h4>Following</h4>
<p>If you're logged in with your Twitch credentials you'll be able to browse channels and categories you've followed.<br />
Unlike Twitch however it doesn't group reruns and premieres together with the live channels, rather it separates them into sections.<br />
On the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> page you can toggle whether to display premieres, reruns, categories and offline channels.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-following.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot following" /></p>
<p><a name="categories"></a></p>
<h4>Categories</h4>
<p>In the categories section you can to browse all the categories on twitch sorted by most popular.<br />
If you click on a category you can browse the channels streaming that category, also sorted by most popular.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-categories.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot categories" /></p>
<p><a name="videos"></a></p>
<h4>Videos</h4>
<p>In the videos section you can browse the current top videos on twitch, this does not include clips however.<br />
By clicking on a video you can view it similar to how a <a href="#streams">stream</a> is viewed.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-videos.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot videos" /></p>
<p><a name="search"></a></p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>In this section you can search for live streams, users or categories.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/projects/fullstream/screenshot-search.jpg" alt="FullStream screenshot search" /></p>
<p><a name="settings"></a></p>
<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>The settings area is divided into sections, some may not be visible depending on if you're logged in with Twitch or not.<br />
A general setting for basic stuff, a following section to toggle visibility of various sub sections on the <a href="#following">Following</a> page, stream details to toggle various information on the top bar and streams pages, and a section for managing channels you are following.  </p>
